    title: "What does it cost?",
    content: `The short answer: nothing. The runs will cost you nothing and there are no entry fees to any of the events. You can join all or any of them just by showing up.
    
    What you need to pay for and organize yourself, are trips between the cities, your possible accommodation, as well as food and beer.
    
    As for our estimates:

    At the time of this writing, a well equipped cabin will cost from 150‚Ç¨ to 250‚Ç¨ total and fits up to 4 persons. This is the preferred option between Stockholm & Tallinn (as well as Helsinki & Stockholm).

    Helsinki - Tallinn is just 80 km so no need to book a cabin, there's boats from multiple cruise lines running morning to evening ‚Äî and these boats have the same luxuries. You're likely looking at 25‚Ç¨ to 30‚Ç¨ per person if not less.

    Hotel: There are some boats that take that trip overnight, the practical runner will just pick a hotel in downtown Helsinki and sleep late, waking up ready for the Sunday run & Fin(n)ishing Party. At the time of writing plenty of rooms available between 70‚Ç¨ to 120‚Ç¨ for two.`,
